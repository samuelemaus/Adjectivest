# Adjectivest

This is a small library for inflecting Adjectives in English between their comparative, superlative, and base forms.

I was working with some NLP libraries in .NET and couldn't find something like this, so I took it upon myself to put this together.

Essentially, if you're working with NLP and have any kind of need to inflect English adjectives, this should cover your need. 

## How to Use:

Clone the repo wherever you'd like:

```
git clone https://github.com/samuelemaus/Adjectivest
```

### Option A) Include Adjectivest in your Solution

#### Installing
______________

*This is assuming you are using Visual Studio.*

In your Solution, right-click on the Solution in the Solution Explorer.  Highlight **'Add'** and select **'Existing Project'**.  Then select the **Adjectivest.csproj** file in the **Adjectivest** directory of wherever you cloned the repository.

You can then reference the Project however you'd like.  When you build your solution, a folder called **'AdjectivestResources'** should appear in your output folder.

#### Using Adjectivest in Code
______________

Add **'Adjectivest'** to your using statements in whatever class you're using Adjectivest with.

The only class you should need to utilize in a typical scenario is the **AdjectiveInflector** class, and you should only need one instance.

##### Loading the resources into memory
______________

The only parameter in the class's constructor is the 'loadDictionaryIntoMemory' bool.  This determines whether the CMU Dictionary is loaded into memory or accessed on-demand.  The difference may be obvious, but loading it into memory is faster on each individual request at the cost of, well, memory.  Accessing it on each request is a bit slower but more memory-efficient.  While this of course depends on the specifications of both the drive and memory in the environment on which the code is deployed, you can expect the in-memory option to be ~10-15x faster than the file-read option.  I'd recommend the in-memory option unless your deployment platform is really hurting for memory.

`AdjectiveInflector inflector = new AdjectiveInflector(true);`

#### Examples:
______________

Use the **'GetAdjectiveInflections'** method to get a pipe-delimited string of the adjective's base, comparative, and superlative forms (in that order).

*Entering a base, comparative, or superlative form of the same adjective should get the same result.*

```
string adj = "heavy";

string inflection = inflector.GetAdjectiveInflections(adj);

//output: "heavy|heavier|heaviest"
//an input of "heavier" or "heaviest" would have same output.
```
